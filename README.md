# Longest Path Matrix Algorithm

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Longest Path Matrix algorithm.

## Description

The Longest Path Matrix algorithm is a method used to find the longest path in a directed acyclic graph. This implementation uses a matrix representation of the graph and calculates the longest path by iterating over the matrix.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries: numpy
3. Run the script: `python longest_path_matrix.py`

## Output

![LPM_Output](https://github.com/AnkitNitrkl/longest-path-matrix/assets/159608076/ed15481f-98c1-4971-8811-b076992ddb1d)


## Dependencies

- numpy

## Further Improvements

- Add error handling for invalid input matrices.
- Optimize the code for better efficiency.
- Include unit tests to ensure correctness.
